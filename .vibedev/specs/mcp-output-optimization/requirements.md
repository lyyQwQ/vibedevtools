# Requirements for MCP Output Display Optimization

## Introduction

This feature optimizes the output display mechanism for VibeSpecs MCP tools. Currently, the MCP tools return complex formatted content (including beautiful box-line drawings and tables), but Claude Code defaults to collapsing these outputs, making them invisible to users. This feature will restructure the output mechanism so that MCP tools return concise structured data, which Claude Code then detects and automatically formats for display, ensuring users can see clear and beautiful information presentation.

## Requirements

### 1. MCP Tool Output Format Standardization

**User Story**: As a VibeSpecs MCP tool developer, I want tools to return standardized structured data instead of complex formatted content, so that the output can be processed consistently by Claude Code.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL define a standard JSON output format with `vibespec_format: "v1"` identifier for all MCP tools
2. The system SHALL include a `type` field in the JSON output to indicate the content type (e.g., "spec_list", "spec_detail", "error")
3. The system SHALL include a `data` field containing the actual structured information
4. The system SHALL ensure all 4 target MCP tools (`vibedev_specs_list`, `vibedev_specs_get_Status`, `vibedev_specs_update_status`, `vibedev_specs_archive`) use this standardized format
5. The system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition period

### 2. Claude Code Output Detection and Formatting

**User Story**: As a Claude Code user, I want the system to automatically detect and format VibeSpecs MCP tool outputs, so that I can see clear and readable information without manually expanding collapsed content.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL detect the presence of `vibespec_format: "v1"` identifier in MCP tool responses
2. The system SHALL automatically trigger formatting logic when the identifier is detected
3. The system SHALL parse the structured data and present it in a clean, readable text format
4. The system SHALL handle different content types (spec_list, spec_detail, error) with appropriate formatting
5. The system SHALL ensure the formatted output is concise and user-friendly without complex visual elements

### 3. Spec List Display Enhancement

**User Story**: As a VibeSpecs user, I want to see a clear overview of all my specs when I request the list, so that I can quickly understand the status and progress of my projects.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL display spec information in a simple, scannable format
2. The system SHALL include essential information: spec name, status, session ID (abbreviated), and last updated time
3. The system SHALL use simple emojis for status indication (üî∑ in progress, ‚úÖ completed, üì¶ archived, ‚è∏Ô∏è paused)
4. The system SHALL provide a summary line showing total count and breakdown by status
5. The system SHALL handle empty states gracefully with helpful guidance

### 4. Spec Detail Display Enhancement

**User Story**: As a VibeSpecs user, I want to see detailed information about a specific spec, so that I can understand its current stage, progress, and relevant documents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL display comprehensive spec information including session ID, feature name, creation/update timestamps
2. The system SHALL show workflow progress with clear stage indicators and completion status
3. The system SHALL include task progress information when in execution stage, parsed from the tasks.md TODO list
4. The system SHALL list relevant document paths for requirements, design, and tasks files
5. The system SHALL present information in a structured, easy-to-read format

### 5. TODO-based Progress Tracking

**User Story**: As a VibeSpecs user, I want to see real-time progress based on completed TODO items in the tasks.md file, so that I can understand exactly how much work is remaining and what has been accomplished.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL parse the tasks.md file to extract TODO items and their completion status
2. The system SHALL calculate progress percentage based on completed vs total TODO items
3. The system SHALL display current task information (which task is currently being worked on)
4. The system SHALL show progress in both numeric format (e.g., "3/8 tasks") and percentage format
5. The system SHALL update progress information in real-time when TODO statuses change
6. The system SHALL handle various TODO formats (- [ ], - [x], different markdown styles)
7. The system SHALL gracefully handle cases where tasks.md doesn't exist or has no TODOs

### 6. Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story**: As a VibeSpecs user, I want to receive clear error messages and status confirmations, so that I understand what went wrong or what actions were completed successfully.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL format error messages in a clear, non-technical manner
2. The system SHALL include helpful suggestions for resolving common errors
3. The system SHALL provide confirmation messages for successful operations (update, archive, restore)
4. The system SHALL maintain consistency in error message format across all tools
5. The system SHALL avoid overwhelming users with technical details while providing enough context

### 7. Performance and Reliability

**User Story**: As a VibeSpecs user, I want the output optimization to be fast and reliable, so that it doesn't slow down my workflow or introduce new issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL process and format output within 100ms of receiving MCP tool response
2. The system SHALL handle malformed JSON gracefully without crashing
3. The system SHALL fall back to original output format if detection or formatting fails
4. The system SHALL maintain all existing functionality while adding the new formatting layer
5. The system SHALL be testable and maintainable with clear separation of concerns

## Success Criteria

- Users can see formatted output from VibeSpecs MCP tools without manually expanding collapsed content
- The output is clean, readable, and provides all necessary information at a glance
- No existing functionality is broken or degraded
- The system is extensible for future output format enhancements
